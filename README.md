# odin-admin-dashboard
CSS Grid Admin Dashboard project from The Odin Project - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard

Final Notes:
- I tried to use only CSS Grid for this project, but ended up using flexbox for some small things
- I gained a much better understanding of CSS Grid through this project and could make the code much cleaner if I remade it
- I got stuck on a tiny bug for way too long, but eventually figured it out
